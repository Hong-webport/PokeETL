# PokeETL

## The Objective:

The goal of the team is to create an interactive website, that displayed data extracted live, load and tell a story within it. The main tools used are Javascripts with the library such as D3, Charts, and others. We picked Pokemon as our subject, because of the great amount of infomation found with its many enthusiatic. Our website acted as a search interface and would have worked with other subjects such as company stocks or city features provided there are sources available.

You can look at more infomation on here https://gitjudd.github.io/teamtriangle/aboutproject.html

#### My Contributions:

Im this projects, my main contribution is writing a heiracle charts. Other charts in the website displayed the statistic attribute of each pokemon. My chart targeted the story aspects. When a pokemon is captured: I would like to learn what cool moves it can do, how thoses moves can be displayed, is it any good and so forth.

These charts are hosted and created LIVE. It could be very useful for hosting or looking up any topics in hierarchical classifications or organizations.   

This ability tree search engine is the result of that https://gitjudd.github.io/teamtriangle/abilitytree.html.
The stand-alone version: https://hong-webport.github.io/poke-tree/abb-index.html.
