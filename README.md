# Guessing-Projector (Beta)

## The Objective:

Gather loads of data from APIs using Python. Train the Data with a Machine Learning Algorithm. Predicting Whether a Movie Will Ended Up in What Streaming Site. Display both the trained data and the predictions on a Tableau Dashboad and represent the Journey in a Tableau Storyboard.

The tableau dashboards functioned similar to a search interface. The data extractions and predictions would have also be made to cover other subjects such as books, apps, etc. 

## My Contributions:

Im this projects, my main contribution is writing the codes that are used to extract the datas, explained the sources and keywords of the data and create the visualizations in Tableau.

## The Results

There are one storyboard ([Journey](https://public.tableau.com/profile/hong.data.learn#!/vizhome/FinalProject11-19-20155Should-be-the-Finale/TheJourney)) and three dashboards([Dash A](https://public.tableau.com/profile/hong.data.learn#!/vizhome/FinalProject11-19-20155Should-be-the-Finale/TheJourney)),([Dash B](https://public.tableau.com/profile/hong.data.learn#!/vizhome/FinalProject11-19-20155Should-be-the-Finale/TheJourney)),([Dash C](https://public.tableau.com/profile/hong.data.learn#!/vizhome/FinalProject11-19-20155Should-be-the-Finale/TheJourney)) to be displayed during our representation. 

The storyboard narrated how our process reach to that conclusion and the dashboard is where we presented the findings. (They would look better on a 1080p full-size desktop monitor screen if you download the workbook.) More practice in tableau behaviors.

#### My Future Projects:

When this project ended, there are thousands of datas that had not been worked on. It were either too big to be shared or too much time to be extracted individually. I fet that those datas are begging for more training. I decided to make another project with what I had. With more time, solutions to such problems can be worked on and with more variables, it would generate better results. 

## Data Extraction

There is a dataset obtained by a Kaggle user, containing 5000 movies with many variables, opened up a huge possibilities. The more data we have, the more variables we can used to train the algorithm. 
 


However, because of the way the API setup, to obtain such a full data sets, it required time we can't afford, not to mentioned that we have way more than 5000. As such the team, decide to limit the variables to SIX and the datasets to three.

## Machine Learning SVM


SVM (Support vector machine): The methods that we used for this, is chosen for its high accuracy for classification predictions, high accuracy for smaller datasets, Popular model and well documented online.

## Tableau


Tableau is a great software used for integrating datas, built dashboards for analysis and documenting our progress for more.
